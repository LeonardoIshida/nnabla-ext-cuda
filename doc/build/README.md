# CUDA Extension Build Manuals

## Quick Build Tools

As same as `nnabla` we provide very useful quick build tools for Linux
and Windows.

* [Quick Build Tools](quick_build_tools.md)

## Standard CMake workflow

Build of the CUDA extension requires building
[NNabla](https://github.com/sony/nnabla) at first. See [the
instruction](https://github.com/sony/nnabla/tree/master/doc/build/)
for build NNabla.

* [Linux/macOS](build.md)
* [Windows](build_windows.md)
